## ▶️ How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:br-programmer/flutter-planets-app.git
cd flutter-planets-app
```

---

### 2. Create your environment config

Copy the example file and insert your API key:

```bash
cp env/env.json.example env/dev.json
```

Example content:

```json
{
    "baseUrl": "your-http-url-here",
    "apiKey": "your-api-key-here"
}
```

---

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

---

### 4. Generate required files

#### 🧊 Freezed, JSON parsing

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

#### 🌍 Translations with Slang

```bash
dart run slang
```

---

### 5. Run with an environment

Use `dart_define_from_file` to pass environment values:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define-from-file env=env/dev.json
```

You can switch `dev.json` for `stg.json` or `prod.json`.

## 🌐 API used

This API requires an API key provided in the environment JSON.
